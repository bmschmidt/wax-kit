<h1>Instructions for Students</h1>

We're almost done! You should be able to see your essays under the "Exhibits" tab above.

<ol>
<li>
  Make sure your essay is appearing, and that you like the title.
  I've put a spreadsheet to manage the essays 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KxlYWOCHD7i7IvzKPXkpvL3L0VDD6hDrgFGrzfZGIMs/edit#gid=0"> here.</a>
  If you want your name to appear, please enter it in the "author_for_public_display" column; and fill the title of your essay in the "title" column.
  </li>
  <li>
      While at 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KxlYWOCHD7i7IvzKPXkpvL3L0VDD6hDrgFGrzfZGIMs/edit#gid=0">that spreadsheet,</a> provide a one-sentence summary and an image link there to show up on the cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    Brush up your essay according to comments in class, and remove whatever's left that reads as a paper in the top. (Your name; my name; "in this essay I will"; etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload any images that you need to use that <em>aren't</em> currently in the "datasets" tab to the "supplemental images" page. 
    This takes two steps:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the image as a jpg or png file in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xG-qqCFYGT6plpnGOKYL_qR_blf_Ctry?ths=true">the Google Drive folder holding all the images.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Update <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m8VFI8qQ-AOL0sXcTnE2aTUlCspaKQbbGZbn6sHTHY0/edit#gid=0">the appendix spreadsheet</a>
        with your filename (not including ".png" or ".jpg") in the pid field, and fully fill out the other columns.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Hopefully they'll show up on this page relatively soon after that, but it may take my pressing a couple of buttons manually.
  </li>
  <li>
  Go to your essay, and embed images that you want to talk about. Do this by finding your image in the "Appendix" or "Dataset" tabs, and copying the 
  identifier from the URL. (This is the same as the filename you entered in earlier.)

  Don't try to include images some other way! This will include the citation that you provided.
    For example, if you want to include the aircraft complaint image, just put (probably on its own line) the following:
    {'{{'}datasets/bell_aircraft_complaint_page_01{'}}'}
  </li>  
  </ol>

# COLLECTION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Wax leverages Jekyll collections for much of its
# functionality, therefor some of the keys below are from
# Jekyll while others are Wax-specific.
# For more info, refer to:
# ~> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

collections:
  exhibits:
    output: true
  datasets: # name of collection
    output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
    layout: 'generic_collection_item' # the layout for the pages to use
    metadata:
      source: 'bigdata1.csv' # path to the metadata file within `_data`
      # The thing after the slash is the individual sheet.
      google_drive_id: '1dAIKPxhCmqgz3r9h21_muJolEVGzRYIN7Syg1_js6qI'
    images:
      source: 'raw_images/images' # path to the directory of images within `_data`
      google_drive_ids:
        - '1xG-qqCFYGT6plpnGOKYL_qR_blf_Ctry'
  appendix:

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# SEARCH INDEX SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# You can create multiple search indexes below (though only one is
# recommended!) by specifying
# an `index` file to write it to and some `collections` for it to index
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:search` .

search:
  main:
    index: '/search/index.json' # file the index will get written to
    collections:
      nara:
        content: true # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
          - label
          - a_number
          - name

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# SITE MENU SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Each menu item needs a `label` (whats shown), and a `link`
# (where it goes). An item can optionally have a dropdown
# submenu via `sub`.

menu:
  - label: 'About'
    sub:
      - label: 'Wax'
        link: '/about/'
      - label: 'Credits'
        link: '/credits/'
  - label: 'Exhibits'
